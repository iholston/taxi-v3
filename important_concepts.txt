In a way, Reinforcement Learning is the science of making optimal decisions using experiences. Breaking it down, the process of Reinforcement Learning involves 
these simple steps:

Observation of the environment
Deciding how to act using some strategy
Acting accordingly
Receiving a reward or penalty
Learning from the experiences and refining our strategy
Iterate until an optimal strategy is found

Reinforcement Learning will learn a mapping of states to the optimal action to perform in that state by exploration, i.e. the agent explores the environment and 
takes actions based off rewards defined in the environment.

The optimal action for each state is the action that has the highest cumulative long-term reward.

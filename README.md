## Synopsis
State Space: 500 states  
Action Space: south, north, east, west, pickup, dropoff  
Q-table: Table mapping 500 states to best action for highest cumulative long-term reward. 
         Updated via q-learning or Q(state, action) = $$(1-\alpha)Q(state, action) + \alpha(reward + \gamma(maxQ(next state, all actions))$$
         Where \alpha = learning rate (0 < \alpha < 1)
               \gamma = discount factor (0 < \gamma < 1), importance of future rewards

Run on Python 3.7 on Windows 10 (ANSI escape code is not recognized so env.render [doesn't work properly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51431428/openai-gym-not-rendering-colors-correctly-in-console-environments))

'In a way, Reinforcement Learning is the science of making optimal decisions using experiences. Breaking it down, the process of Reinforcement Learning involves these simple steps:

Observation of the environment
Deciding how to act using some strategy
Acting accordingly
Receiving a reward or penalty
Learning from the experiences and refining our strategy
Iterate until an optimal strategy is found'

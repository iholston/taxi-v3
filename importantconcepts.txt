In a way, Reinforcement Learning is the science of making optimal decisions using experiences. Breaking it down, the process of Reinforcement Learning involves 
these simple steps:

Observation of the environment
Deciding how to act using some strategy
Acting accordingly
Receiving a reward or penalty
Learning from the experiences and refining our strategy
Iterate until an optimal strategy is found

Reinforcement Learning will learn a mapping of states to the optimal action to perform in that state by exploration, i.e. the agent explores the environment and takes actions based off rewards defined in the environment.
